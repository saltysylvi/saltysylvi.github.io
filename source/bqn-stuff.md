This is a little web page I made to convert tacit BQN to block form.
It is also an experiment in concision: the whole thing is just one html file with around 300 sloc.
Was it a good idea to write really dense js and cram everything into one file? Probably not.

## Blog

[https://saltysylvi.github.io/blog/](https://saltysylvi.github.io/blog/)

I enjoy writing about BQN.
Check out my [BQN macros](blog/bqn-macros.md) post where I create a 1-modifier that turns a train into a left-to-right chain of monads, or see my post on [parsing lists in BQN](blog/parsing-nested-lists-in-bqn.md) where I demonstrate simple array-style parsing.
Even the blog itself is generated from markdown files by [a minimalist BQN script](blog/site-generator-docs-0.md)!

## Advent of Code

I've completed most of Advent of Code 2022 in BQN.
Around day 15 I got busy with the holidays, but I intend to go back and finish it eventually.
I'd also like to complete the earlier years in BQN, and perhaps even write up some annotated solutions.
