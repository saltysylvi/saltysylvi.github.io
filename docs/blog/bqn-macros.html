<h1>BQN "macros" with <code>•Decompose</code></h1>

<p>02/04/2023
</p>
<p>Using <code>•Decompose</code> to create functions with access to the syntax tree of their arguments.
</p>
<hr>

<p>I just learned about the BQN system function <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/spec/system.html#operation-properties"><code>•Decompose</code></a>, and it's really cool.
As its name suggests, <code>•Decompose</code> breaks down a compound function, giving access to the parts of the function and specifying how they were combined.
In other words, it grants us access to the syntax tree of a tacit function, sort of like a Lisp macro.
</p>
<p>This is a powerful ability!
It allows us to do dark magic in opposition to BQN's "no magic" design philosophy.
</p>
<p>There are limitations, however.
<code>•Decompose</code> only does something useful with tacit functions. 
It doesn't delay evaluation of its argument or anything like that.
So if we call it on <code>2+2</code> it only sees <code>4</code>.
Also we can't pass it something with invalid syntax like <code>4+</code>.
</p>
<p>In this blog post, I demonstrate two uses of <code>•Decompose</code>:
alternate train semantics and symbolic differentiation.
</p>
<h2>Using <code>•Decompose</code></h2>

<p><code>•Decompose</code> breaks down a function and returns a list.
The first element of the list is a code indicating what kind of structure the function has.
The rest of the elements are the components of the function.
Here are a couple examples:
</p>
<pre>
   •Decompose ⊑⟨+´÷≠⟩
⟨ 3 +´ ÷ ≠ ⟩
</pre>

<p>3 indicates that the original function was a 3-train.
</p>
<pre>
   •Decompose ⊑⟨|∘-⟩
⟨ 5 | ∘ - ⟩
</pre>

<p>5 indicates that the original function was a 2-modifier applied to two functions.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>•Decompose</code> is a function and not a modifier, so we need to pass it a function with a subject role.
Putting a function in a list and then extracting it from the list with <code>⊑</code> is one way to do that.
</p>
<p>Also note that <code>•Decompose</code> only breaks down one level of a function.
For example, it did not further break down <code>+´</code> in the first example.
</p>
<p>Here is the full list of codes and what they mean:
</p><pre>
Code  Kind
----  ----
-1    Non-operation
0     Primitive
1     Other
2     2-train
3     3-train
4     1-modifier
5     2-modifier
</pre>

<p>Codes -1, 0, and 1 correspond to things that are not compound functions.
</p>
<p>With those preliminaries out the way,
let's write a helper function that handles breaking a function down all the way into its AST (abstract syntax tree), as well as an inverse that handles reassembling an AST into a function.
</p>
<pre>
   AST ← {
     𝕊: {2&gt;⊑𝕩 ? 1⊑𝕩; AST¨⌾(1⊸↓)𝕩} •Decompose 𝕩;
     𝕊⁼: U ← AST⁼¨ 1⊸↓
       {
         0=≡𝕩 ? 𝕩 ;
         2=⊑𝕩 ? g‿h←U𝕩 ⋄ G H;
         3=⊑𝕩 ? f‿g‿h←U𝕩 ⋄ F G H;
         4=⊑𝕩 ? f‿r←U𝕩 ⋄ F _r;
         5=⊑𝕩 ? f‿r‿g←U𝕩 ⋄ F _r_ G
       } 𝕩
   }
</pre>

<p>The function <code>AST</code> recursively decomposes its argument.
The base case is when the code given by <code>•Decompose</code> is less than 2, i.e. no decomposition can be done. 
In this case it just returns the un-decomposable thing, which is always the second element of the result of <code>•Decompose</code>.
In every other case, <code>AST</code> calls itself on each component of the function, i.e. every element of the result of <code>•Decompose</code> besides the first element which is the code.
</p>
<p>The inverse is a little fancier.
The base case is when the argument is not a list, in which case we return the argument unchanged.
Otherwise, we recursively call the inverse on each subtree to turn them back into functions/modifiers, and then we combine the values depending on the code.
Since the result of <code>AST⁼</code> has a subject role, we need a bit of cross-role gymnastics to turn the results back into functions/modifiers so we can combine them.
</p>
<pre>
   AST ⊑⟨+´⌾(×˜)⟩
⟨ 5 ⟨ 4 + ´ ⟩ ⌾ ⟨ 4 × ˜ ⟩ ⟩
   AST⁼ ⟨5,⟨4,+,´⟩,⌾,⟨4,×,˜⟩⟩
+´⌾(×˜)
</pre>

<p>Looks good!
</p>
<p>The beauty of using the <code>𝕊⁼</code> header is that we can now write a tree transformation <code>T</code> and call <code>T⌾AST</code> on a function to turn it into an AST, operate on the AST with <code>T</code>, and then turn it back into a function, without needing to write the reassembly code each time.
</p>
<p>Onward to examples!
</p>
<h2>Alternate Train Semantics</h2>

<p>One of the minor problems with BQN is that <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/commentary/problems.html#trains-dont-like-monads">trains don't like monads</a>.
In particular, it's slightly awkward to write a long chain of monads in tacit form.
We've got to write a bunch of <code>∘</code>s or <code>·</code>s.
</p>
<p>We're gonna make a one modifier, <code>_c</code> ("c" for compose? chain? you decide!), 
that applies to trains and turns them into a sequence of monads.
</p>
<p>We can accomplish this by turning 3-trains <code>F G H</code> into nested 2-trains <code>F(G H)</code>.
</p>
<p>Here's the tree transforming function:
</p><pre>
   T ← {
     ⟨2,g,h⟩: ⟨2, T g, T h⟩;
     ⟨3,f,g,h⟩: ⟨2, T f, ⟨2, T g, T h⟩⟩;
     ⟨4,f,r⟩: ⟨4, T f, r⟩;
     ⟨5,f,r,g⟩: ⟨5, T f, r, T g⟩;
     𝕩: 𝕩
   }
</pre>

<p>BQN's basic pattern matching makes functions like these a joy to write.
</p>
<pre>
   T⌾AST ⊑⟨⌽ +` 1⊸+ 2⊸× ↕⟩
⌽(+`(1⊸+(2⊸×↕)))
</pre>

<p>We can see that it has indeed transformed the train into a bunch of nested 2-trains.
</p>
<p>Next, let's package this up as a 1-modifier.
</p>
<pre>
   _c ← {T⌾AST 𝕗}
   (⌽ +` 1⊸+ 2⊸× ↕)_c 6
⟨ 36 25 16 9 4 1 ⟩
</pre>

<p>To make a 1-modifier, we simply call <code>T⌾AST</code> on <code>𝕗</code>, the operand in a subject role.
The result of a 1-modifier always has a function role, so that's all we need to do.
The example shows it works. Neat!
But we can go even further in perverting BQN...
</p>
<p>What if instead of a right-to-left application of monads, we made it a left-to-right application?
We can even put the argument on the left side!
</p>
<p>To do this we write just write another simple tree transforming function.
</p><pre>
   T ← {
     ⟨2,g,h⟩: ⟨2, T h, T g⟩;
     ⟨3,f,g,h⟩: ⟨2, T h, ⟨2, T g, T f⟩⟩;
     ⟨4,f,r⟩: ⟨4, T f, r⟩;
     ⟨5,f,r,g⟩: ⟨5, T f, r, T g⟩;
     𝕩: 𝕩
   }
   _c ← {(T⌾AST 𝕗){𝔽}𝕨}
</pre>

<p><code>T</code> is pretty much what we had before, but with all the 2-trains getting reversed.
In <code>_c</code> we now use the block 1-modifier <code>{𝔽}</code> to give <code>T⌾AST 𝕗</code> a function role so that we can apply it to the left argument <code>𝕨</code>.
</p>
<pre>
   6 (↕ 2⊸× 1⊸+ +` ⌽)_c@
⟨ 36 25 16 9 4 1 ⟩
</pre>

<p>Now we can put the argument on the left and write a sequence of functions in left-to-right order!
Very cool.
Note that we still need a right argument, so we just put a <code>@</code> at the end.
</p>
<p>Is this useful?
I don't know. Maybe.
While I love a good left to right data pipeline,
this probably does more harm than good by being magic and confusing.
</p>
<h2>Symbolic Differentiation</h2>

<p>Another use of <code>•Decompose</code> is writing a symbolic differentiation 1-modifier, for uh, math reasons I guess.
</p>
<p>Our modifier will work on the following functions:<br>
constants with and without <code>˙</code>;<br>
monads <code>⊢</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>÷</code>, and <code>⋆</code>;<br>
partially applied dyads <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>×</code>, <code>÷</code>, and <code>⋆</code>;<br>
2-trains;<br>
3-trains with <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>×</code>, and <code>÷</code> as the middle function.
</p>
<p>We could add more cases, but we're just making a proof of concept here.
</p>
<pre>
   T ← {
     ⟨4, f, r⟩: {r=⊑⟨˙⟩ ? 0}; # constants
     ⟨5,f,r,g⟩: { # partially applied dyads
       r‿g≡⊸‿+ ? 1;
       r‿f≡⟜‿+ ? 1;
       r‿g≡⊸‿- ? ¯1;
       r‿f≡⟜‿- ? 1;
       r‿g≡⊸‿× ? f;
       r‿f≡⟜‿× ? g;
       r‿g≡⊸‿÷ ? -f÷⋆⟜2;
       r‿f≡⟜‿÷ ? 1÷g;
       r‿g≡⊸‿⋆ ? (⋆⁼f)⊸× f⊸⋆;
       r‿f≡⟜‿⋆ ? g×⋆⟜(g-1)
     };
     ⟨2,f,g⟩: ⟨3, T g, ×, ⟨2, T f, g⟩⟩; # 2-trains
     ⟨3,f,g,h⟩: { # 3-trains
       g=⊑⟨+⟩ ? ⟨3, T f, +, T h⟩;
       g=⊑⟨-⟩ ? ⟨3, T f, -, T g⟩;
       g=⊑⟨×⟩ ? ⟨3, ⟨3, h, ×, T f⟩, +, ⟨3, f, ×, T h⟩⟩;
       g=⊑⟨÷⟩ ? ⟨3, ⟨3, ⟨3, h, ×, T f⟩, -, ⟨3, f, ×, T h⟩⟩, ÷, ⟨2, ⋆⟜2, h⟩⟩
     };
     𝕩: { # monads
       𝕩=⊑⟨⊢⟩ ? 1;
       𝕩=⊑⟨-⟩ ? ¯1;
       𝕩=⊑⟨÷⟩ ? -1÷⋆⟜2;
       𝕩=⊑⟨⋆⟩ ? ⋆;
       0 # everything else presumed 0
     }𝕩
   }

   _d ← {T⌾AST 𝕗}
</pre>

<p>Here's the tree transforming function <code>T</code> and a 1-modifier that applies <code>T⌾AST</code> to a function.
(By the way, is anybody else getting a craving for some toast?)
Unfortunately, we can't directly write cases like <code>⟨3,f,+,g⟩</code> because BQN doesn't allow functions in lists in case headers.
I'm not sure why, to be honest.
</p>
<p>The code should be straightforward if you remember your calculus.
The only catches are that we assume the left operand of <code>⊸</code> and the right operand of <code>⟜</code> are numbers,
and we assume that the derivative of any non-compound argument that isn't <code>⊢</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>÷</code>, or <code>⋆</code> is 0.
Better code would of course be more careful about these things.
</p>
<p>Let's try it out.
</p>
<pre>
   ⋆⟜2 _d
2×⋆⟜1
</pre>

<p>Yup, using more conventional notation, the derivative of <code>x^2</code> is <code>2x</code>.
The code we wrote isn't smart enough to know that <code>x^1</code> is <code>x</code>.
</p>
<pre>
   (⋆⟜2 +⟜1)_d
1×((2×⋆⟜1)+⟜1)
   (⋆⟜2 +⟜1)_d _d
(((2×⋆⟜1)+⟜1)×0{𝔽})+1×1×(((⋆⟜1×0{𝔽})+2×1×⋆⟜0)+⟜1)
</pre>

<p>The derivative of <code>(x+1)^2</code> is <code>2(x+1)</code>.
Again, our code doesn't simplify away the <code>1×</code> or <code>⋆⟜1</code> so the result is cluttered.
Taking a second derivative, we can see just how bad it really is.
But if you study that monstrous expression long enough, you can confirm it is indeed just 2.
</p>
<pre>
   ((((2×⋆⟜1)+⟜1)×0{𝔽})+1×1×(((⋆⟜1×0{𝔽})+2×1×⋆⟜0)+⟜1)) ↕10
⟨ 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ⟩
</pre>

<p>Let use <code>_d</code> to write a root finder using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton's method</a>.
</p>
<pre>
   _newton_ ← {-⟜(𝔽÷𝔽_d)⍟𝕘 𝕩}
</pre>

<p>The left operand to <code>_newton_</code> is the function to find a root of,
and the right operand is the number of iterations.
The argument to the resulting function is the intial guess. 
</p>
<p>Let's find some roots!
</p>
<pre>
   (-⟜2 ⋆⟜2)_newton_ 20 1
1.414213562373095
   √2
1.414213562373095
   (⋆⟜2-+⟜1)_newton_ 20 1
1.618033809079597
   (1+√5)÷2
1.618033988749895
</pre>

<p>Here we've calculated the square root of 2 and the golden ratio using the fact that the former is a root of <code>x^2-2</code> and the latter is a root of <code>x^2-(x+1)</code>.
Neato.
</p>
<p>So, is this useful?
In its current state, not very.
But I could see far more sophisticated code built on this idea being useful.
For example, somebody could implement efficient reverse-mode automatic differentiation for quickly prototyping machine learning models or something like that.
</p>
<p>That's all for now. Happy array programming! &lt;3
