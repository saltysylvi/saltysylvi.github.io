<p>This is a little web page I made to convert tacit BQN to block form.
It is also an experiment in concision: the whole thing is just one html file with around 300 sloc.
Was it a good idea to write really dense js and cram everything into one file? Probably not.

<h2>Blog</h2>

</p>
<p>I enjoy writing about BQN.
Check out my <a href="blog/bqn-macros.html">BQN macros</a> post where I create a 1-modifier that turns a train into a left-to-right chain of monads, or see my post on <a href="blog/parsing-nested-lists-in-bqn.html">parsing lists in BQN</a> where I demonstrate simple array-style parsing.
Even the blog itself is generated from markdown files by <a href="blog/site-generator-docs-0.html">a minimalist BQN script</a>!

<h2>Advent of Code</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/saltysylvi/bqn-aoc2022">https://github.com/saltysylvi/bqn-aoc2022</a>
</p>
<p>I've completed most of Advent of Code 2022 in BQN.
Around day 15 I got busy with the holidays, but I intend to go back and finish it eventually.
I'd also like to complete the earlier years in BQN, and perhaps even write up some annotated solutions.
