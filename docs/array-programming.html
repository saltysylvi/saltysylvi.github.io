<h1>Array Programming</h1>

<p>Where I collect links related to my array programming activities.<br>
Array programming here refers to APL and its descendents J and BQN.

</p>
<p>This is a little web page I made to convert tacit BQN to block form.
It is also an experiment in concision: the whole thing is just one html file with &lt;300 sloc.

<h2>Advent of Code</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/saltysylvi/bqn-aoc2022">https://github.com/saltysylvi/bqn-aoc2022</a>
</p>
<p>I've completed most of Advent of Code 2022 in BQN.
Around day 15 I got busy with the holidays, but I intend to go back and finish it eventually.
I'd also like to complete the earlier years in BQN, and perhaps even write up some annotated solutions.

<h2>Project Euler</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/saltysylvi/bqn-aoc2022">https://github.com/saltysylvi/j-project-euler</a>
</p>
<p>I'm trying to create a single 100 line j file where each line solves the corresponding Project Euler problem.
I'm also explaining (not in very much detail, tbh) how the solutions work.
Not very far yet.
